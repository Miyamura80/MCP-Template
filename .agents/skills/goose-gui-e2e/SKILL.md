# Goose-GUI end-to-end testing of the MCP Apps

Goose (Block's open-source agent, an Agentic AI Foundation reference MCP client)
renders MCP Apps natively - it fetches a tool's `ui://` resource and mounts the
HTML in a sandboxed iframe. This skill stands up the **real Goose desktop app**
(Electron), wires **this template's `/mcp` mount** into it as a streamable-HTTP
extension, drives a chat scenario with **Playwright-Electron** (DOM selectors, no
pixel coordinates), and decides PASS/FAIL from two records the mock LLM cannot
fake: the **rendered iframe DOM** and the **tool-call round-trip log**.

This closes the L4 "rendered iframe in a real host" gap from issue #37 - the layer
`tests/test_mcp_e2e.py` (wire) and the per-app vitest (component) deliberately
don't cover. It's ported from Edison-Watch's `goose-gui-e2e` harness; the Goose
build under `$E2E_HOME/goose_src` is repo-agnostic and shared with it.

```

## Quickstart

```bash
cd .agents/skills/goose-gui-e2e/scripts     # or the symlink under .claude/skills/
export E2E_HOME="$HOME/goose-e2e"           # working dir (default; override freely)

bash setup.sh                # ONE TIME: build goose + Electron + bundles (~6-8 min). Idempotent.
bash up.sh                   # seed e2e DB + API key; start template server + mock + vite (idempotent)
bash run_test.sh settings_render   # drive the GUI + assert -> PASS/FAIL, screenshot in $E2E_HOME
bash run_all.sh              # run every scenario, print a summary
bash down.sh                 # stop test services  (down.sh --reset also drops the e2e DB + key)
```

`make test_apps_e2e` runs `up.sh && run_all.sh`. Each `run_test.sh` writes a
screenshot of the real Goose GUI (with the Settings app rendered) to
`$E2E_HOME/shot_<scenario>.png`.

## Where this runs in the suite

Heavy tier - **not** in `make ci` (which stays Node/Rust/Electron-free):

- **Local / make:** `make test_apps_e2e` (after the one-time `setup.sh`).
- **Full pytest suite:** `tests/test_apps_e2e.py` is a collectable member, **skipped
  by default**; opt in with `RUN_APPS_E2E=1` (e.g. `RUN_APPS_E2E=1 uv run pytest
  tests/test_apps_e2e.py --no-cov`). It shells out to `up.sh` + `run_all.sh`.
  (`--no-cov` keeps a single-file run from tripping `pytest.ini`'s coverage gate.)
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/apps_e2e.yaml` - `workflow_dispatch` + weekly cron. It
  builds Goose via `setup.sh` (open egress, so the npmmirror preconditions below
  don't apply on GitHub runners) and runs the guarded pytest entry.

## Preconditions (verify before setup)

- **npmmirror on the network allowlist.** Electron's binary is fetched from a
  mirror because GitHub release assets are egress-blocked in the sandbox. In the
  environment's **Network access → Custom**, add `registry.npmmirror.com` and
  `cdn.npmmirror.com` (keep the default package-manager list checked). `setup.sh`
  preflights this and fails loudly if it's missing.
- Sandbox provides: `cargo`, `pnpm`/`node`, `bun`, `uv`, `xvfb-run`. `setup.sh`
  uses `git clone` (allowed) + the mirror - none of the GitHub-blocked paths.

## How a scenario works

A scenario is JSON in `scripts/scenarios/<name>.json`:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Open my settings.",
  "plan": [ { "match": "webhook_settings" } ],
  "final": "Opened your settings.",
  "app_uri": "ui://mymcp/settings",
  "expect": {
    "tool_called": "webhook_settings",
    "round_trip": true,
    "app_rendered": true,
    "dom_contains": ["Settings", "Gmail"]
  }
}
```

- `prompt` - the user message typed into Goose.
- `plan` - the tool-call sequence the **mock** emits. `match` is a substring of
  the tool name Goose offers (Goose may namespace extension tools, so substring
  not exact). A plan step may carry `"args"` (e.g. `{"match": "gmail_get_thread",
  "args": {"thread_id": "t-1001"}}`) which the mock passes through as the tool
  call's arguments. Pick an **app-returning** tool: `webhook_settings` →
  `ui://mymcp/settings` renders offline with zero external deps, and
  `gmail_get_thread` → `ui://mymcp/gmail_inbox` renders offline **because the
  stack sets `GMAIL_FAKE_BACKEND=1`** (see below).
- `expect` - checked by `mcp_probe.py`: `tool_called` + `round_trip` (from the
  tool-call log) and `app_rendered` + `dom_contains` (from the rendered iframe).

### Rendering the Gmail apps offline (`GMAIL_FAKE_BACKEND`)

The `gmail_inbox` / `gmail_composer` apps normally need a linked Google account:
`gmail_get_thread` → `_get_gmail_client()` raises `GmailNotConnectedError`
(`ConnectRequiredError`) with no token row, so the tool errors **before**
`send_app` and the iframe never mounts. To render them offline, `up.sh` starts
the server with `GMAIL_FAKE_BACKEND=1`, which makes `_get_gmail_client` return a
fixture-serving fake (`services/_gmail_fake_backend.py`) instead of hitting
Google - no linked account, OAuth, or network. The fixtures are raw-Gmail-API
shaped, so the *real* service parsing → Pydantic `GmailThread` runs end-to-end;
only the network boundary is faked. The flag is **hard-refused under
`DEV_ENV=prod`** (guard in `services.gmail_svc._maybe_fake_gmail_client`), so it
can never stand in for a real mailbox in production.

**Why the fake also serves the curated inbox:** the `gmail_inbox` app registers
its `ontoolresult` handler in a mount effect, and if the host delivers the thread
result *before* that runs, the app misses it and falls back to a curated-inbox
refresh (`gmail_inbox.refresh` → `gmail_curate_inbox`) after ~800ms. So a
thread-open renders the **reader** when it wins that race and the **curated list**
when it loses. The fake serves both paths from the same fixture thread, and
`gmail_thread_render` asserts on content present in both views, so the scenario is
deterministic instead of ~30% flaky. `gmail_get_thread`'s round-trip is still
proven independently via the tool-call log regardless of which view renders.

### Optional: a click → `callServerTool` → re-render step

A scenario may add an `interact` block to drive a real control **inside** the app
iframe after it renders, exercising a **user-initiated** server round-trip (the
`settings_subscribe` fixture does this - clicks "Add endpoint" → `settings.subscribe`):

```json
"expect": { "...": "...", "interaction_rendered": true },
"interact": {
  "fill":  { "selector": "input[type=url]", "value": "https://webhook.example.com/e2e" },
  "click": { "text": "Add endpoint" },
  "expect_dom_contains": ["Signing secret", "webhook.example.com"]
}
```

The iframe's `callServerTool` goes **app → Goose → `/mcp` directly, bypassing the
mock LLM**, so this round-trip never appears in the tool-call log - the re-rendered
DOM (`expect_dom_contains`, here the returned signing secret) is the only proof,
and only the server's real response can produce it. For post-interaction DOM that
plain text can't see, `interact` also accepts `"expect_selectors": ["css", ...]` -
CSS selectors that must each match at least one element (e.g.
`img[src^="data:image/png;base64,"]` to prove a fetched image's data URI was
written into the iframe DOM - presence, not paint). `interaction_rendered: true`
makes `mcp_probe.py` require it, and `pw_scenario.mjs` fails the drive if the
post-click DOM never matches. This needs the "Add endpoint" control, which renders
only when `push_available` is true - `up.sh` sets `GMAIL_PUBSUB_TOPIC` to ungate it
(no Pub/Sub is ever contacted).

## Why the mock cannot fake a PASS

The mock only follows the plan and returns canned narration; it never inspects
tool results. The verdict is computed by `mcp_probe.py` from two records the mock
doesn't control:
- **the rendered iframe** - `pw_scenario.mjs` frameLocators into the real Goose
  DOM and asserts the Settings app's text. The iframe only exists if the server
  returned the app resource and Goose fetched + mounted it - a full round-trip.
- **the tool-call log** - the calls Goose actually issued to `/mcp` and the
  results the server returned.

Two gates stop a no-op run from passing on stale data:
- **Drive must render.** `pw_scenario.mjs` exits non-zero unless the app iframe
  rendered with the expected DOM; `run_test.sh` checks it (`PIPESTATUS[0]`).
- **Log must be new.** `run_test.sh` snapshots the tool-call-log line count before
  driving; `mcp_probe.py` FAILs if no new entries were appended for this run.

## Mock vs. real LLM

- **Mock (default):** deterministic, offline, CI-friendly. `configure_goose.sh mock`.
- **Real LLM:** `configure_goose.sh real anthropic $KEY` (model via `$GOOSE_REAL_MODEL`).
  The agent decides tool calls from the `prompt`; requires an API key **and** the
  provider host on the allowlist. The render/round-trip assertions are unchanged.

## Sandbox gotchas already handled (do not re-discover)

Baked into the scripts; listed so you recognize them if something drifts:

| Symptom | Cause → handled by |
|---|---|
| Electron binary 403 | GitHub release assets blocked → mirror + checksum (`setup.sh`) |
| `@electron/node-gyp` 403 on `pnpm install` | git tarball on codeload blocked → registry override (`setup.sh`) |
| Electron SIGSEGV "Missing X server" | needs a display → `xvfb-run` owns Xvfb per test |
| Electron crash under Xvfb | `--no-sandbox --disable-gpu` (NOT `--in-process-gpu`) |
| CDP `/json` empty / debug-port hang | Playwright-Electron launches over a CDP pipe |
| bg service dies next tool call | `setsid ... & disown` (`start_detached`); re-run `up.sh` to recover |
| `/mcp` 401 | the extension must send the seeded `X-API-KEY` header (`configure_goose.sh`) |
| app iframe not found | assert only on an **app-returning** tool; the Settings app renders offline |

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `lib.sh` | paths/ports + bounded-wait/`setsid` helpers |
| `setup.sh` | one-time provisioning: build goose, Electron via mirror, pnpm install, dev bundle |
| `seed.py` | create the e2e SQLite schema + one API key; prints the raw key |
| `up.sh` / `down.sh` | idempotent stack bring-up / teardown |
| `configure_goose.sh` | write Goose config for `mock`/`real`, wiring the `mymcp` extension at `/mcp` |
| `mock_llm.py` | scenario-engine mock LLM (follows the plan, logs tool calls) |
| `pw_scenario.mjs` | Playwright-Electron driver + rendered-iframe DOM assertion |
| `mcp_probe.py` | assertion oracle - rendered iframe (`pw_result`) + tool round-trip (`toolcalls.jsonl`) |
| `run_test.sh` / `run_all.sh` | drive + assert one / all scenarios |
| `scenarios/settings_render.json` | scenario 1: LLM opens the Settings app; assert it renders |
| `scenarios/settings_subscribe.json` | scenario 2: click "Add endpoint" → `settings.subscribe` → assert the re-render |
| `scenarios/gmail_thread_render.json` | scenario 3: LLM opens a thread via `gmail_get_thread`; assert the gmail_inbox reader iframe renders (needs `GMAIL_FAKE_BACKEND`) |
| `scenarios/gmail_remote_images.json` | scenario 4: remote-image pipeline - assert the blocked-by-default "Show images" banner renders, click it, and assert the `gmail_inbox.fetch_image` round-trip re-renders as "Retry" (fixture URL is `.invalid`, so the SSRF guard rejects it deterministically offline and in CI) |

Also outside the skill: `tests/test_apps_e2e.py` (guarded pytest entry) and
`.github/workflows/apps_e2e.yaml` (opt-in CI).
