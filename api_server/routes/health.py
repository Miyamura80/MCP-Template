"""Health-check endpoints.

``GET /health`` is public and deliberately minimal: a liveness signal only
(``{"status": "ok"}``), with no dependency probes at all.  Build identity
(version, git commit) and the per-component breakdown are information
disclosure to an anonymous caller (ASVS V14.3.3) - this codebase is open
source, so a commit SHA tells an attacker exactly which code is deployed.
Those details, and the readiness rollup, live on ``GET /health/detail``, which
requires authentication.  See ``health_check`` for why probing on the public
path is an availability hazard rather than a nicety.

    Runs **no dependency probes**.  Liveness and readiness are different
    questions and this endpoint answers only the first, for three reasons:

    - ``db/engine.py`` builds the engine with ``pool_pre_ping=True`` and no
      connect timeout, so a database host that stops answering SYN blocks the
      probe on OS TCP retries (~130s on Linux).  The Dockerfile healthcheck is
      ``--timeout=5s --retries=3``, so probing here would turn a slow
      dependency into a container restart loop.
    - This is a sync ``def``, so it runs on the anyio threadpool.  A probe that
      blocks lets unauthenticated callers park every thread in that pool and
      stall every other sync route in the app.  ``db/engine.py`` now bounds the
      connect at ``CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``, but a bounded probe on an
      anonymous endpoint is still a lever an attacker can pull for free.
    - A per-component rollup readable by anonymous callers is a disclosure
      oracle in its own right ("one of their backends is erroring right now").

    Nothing consumes the rollup: Railway ``healthcheckPath``, Render
    ``healthCheckPath`` and the Dockerfile ``HEALTHCHECK`` all assert on the
    status code alone.  Readiness lives on ``/health/detail``.

    This is a sync ``def`` and it does probe, so the threadpool argument in

    lever, not that it exists.  What bounds it is ``db/engine.py``'s
