"""Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming routes.

These endpoints deliberately live *outside* the auto-generated
``services.py`` registry. That registry mirrors the "one input model in, one
output model out" service contract identically across CLI/MCP/API - a streamed
response breaks that contract, so streaming variants are hand-written here and
only added for services that genuinely benefit from incremental output.

``POST /api/v1/stream/doctor`` is the first such endpoint: ``doctor`` runs a
sequence of discrete checks, several of which shell out (``uv sync --dry-run``
blocks up to 30s), so streaming each result as it lands turns a ~30s silent
wait into a live, CI-style checklist. The pure ``doctor`` service stays unary
and unchanged; this route consumes the ``iter_doctor`` generator instead.
