    back from Google's OAuth consent screen, which ``strict`` would drop.

# Outermost, deliberately: it is the only middleware that must stamp *every*
# byte-producing path, including CORS preflights, the MCPAuthMiddleware 401
# challenge (which writes to `send` directly), and the FastMCP mount below.
#
# On the mount: `mount_mcp_server(app)` calls `app.mount("/", mcp_app)`, which
# registers an ordinary route on `app.router`. `add_middleware` wraps the
# router, not the individual routes, so /mcp responses traverse this middleware
# exactly like /health does - the mount does not bypass it. That holds only
# because the mount goes through `app.mount`; a second ASGI app composed
# *around* `app` (e.g. `Mount("/mcp", mcp_app)` in a parent Starlette router)
# would need its own registration.
#
# The docs paths are read off the app rather than hardcoded in the middleware,
# so customising or disabling `docs_url`/`redoc_url` can never leave the looser
# CSP pointed at a path FastAPI no longer serves the bundles on.
