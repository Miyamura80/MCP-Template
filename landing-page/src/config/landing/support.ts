 * Support & contact: the self-serve troubleshooting and the human channels a

 * Data-driven like the rest of the config: this one module feeds the `/support`
 * page, its `/help` and `/contact` aliases, the `/support.md` twin, and the
 * `## Support` section of llms.txt / agents.md / llms-full.txt. Point it at a
 * real inbox (see the TODO below) and it is live everywhere.
 *
 * Order is deliberate: troubleshooting first (most "issues" are setup, and an
 * agent or user should self-serve before opening a ticket), then the channels.
