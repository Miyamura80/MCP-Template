"""Which tool exceptions the model is allowed to read.

python-sdk 2.x sanitizes tool failures: only a ``ToolError`` keeps its text;
any other exception reaches the client as a bare ``Error executing tool
<name>`` (``UnexpectedToolError``, original kept as ``__cause__``). v1 passed
every exception's text through.

This template's services are written to fail with model-facing messages - a
``ConnectRequiredError`` carries its own recovery script, PDF/Gmail domain
errors say what to do next, the scope check and the daily quota explain the
refusal - and the pure services must not import MCP types to say so. So the
server (``mcp_server.server._TemplateMCPServer``) re-labels the crash as a
``ToolError`` when its cause is one of those *first-party* failures, and keeps
the SDK's sanitization for everything else (SQLAlchemy, HTTP client, and other
third-party crashes whose text may carry internals).
