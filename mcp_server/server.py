"""MCPServer (python-sdk 2.x) that registers services as MCP tools and exposes app HTML resources.

Two registration paths (see `_tool_factory.py` for details):

- **Headless** (default): sync wrapper, returns the Pydantic output model directly.
- **Enhanced** (opt-in via `@enhance`): async wrapper with `Context`, may elicit
  user input, attach images/audio, or render an MCP App (iframe dashboard).

Primary transport is streamable HTTP, mounted on the FastAPI app at ``/mcp``
(see ``api_server/server.py``). Stdio is supported via the ``mymcp-mcp``
console script for local dev / Claude Desktop only.

See ``mcp_server/MCP_UI_ARCHITECTURE.md`` and ``mcp_server/MCP_UI_EDGE_CASES.md``.

# Protocol eras (python-sdk 2.x, spec 2026-07-28). One ``streamable_http_app``
# serves every revision; the session manager routes by the
# ``MCP-Protocol-Version`` header:
#
# - **2026-07-28 (stateless core).** No ``initialize`` handshake, no
#   ``Mcp-Session-Id``: every request is a self-contained POST carrying the
#   protocol version, client info and client capabilities in its ``_meta``
#   (``io.modelcontextprotocol/*`` keys), so any replica can serve any request.
#   Server-initiated requests (push elicitation, sampling, roots) do not exist
#   on this wire - ``ctx.elicit()`` raises ``NoBackChannelError``; input is
#   gathered with multi-round-trip requests (MRTR, ``InputRequiredResult``)
#   instead. ``server/discover`` replaces the handshake for capability lookup.
# - **2025-11-25 and earlier (handshake era).** Clients still ``initialize``
#   and the legacy transport below handles them. ``stateless_http`` only
#   affects this path (2026-07-28 traffic never reads it).
#
# ``stateless_http=True`` (the config default) keeps legacy clients working in
# the deployments this template targets - Render free-tier spin-down,
# redeploys and multi-replica routing each wipe/split an in-memory session
# store, so a stateful client's next POST would fail with
# ``mcp_session_terminated``. The legacy trade-off is unchanged: in-band
# elicitation cannot complete stateless (the client's response POST lands on
# a fresh transport), so every elicitation call site gates on the client
# having DECLARED the capability AND the request having a back-channel (see
# ``EnhancedTool.can_elicit``); enhancers take their non-elicitation
# fallbacks otherwise. Legacy deployments that want host-native elicitation
# (e.g. the PDF signing confirmation dialog) must run a single replica and set
# ``server.mcp_stateless_http: false``.
#
# MCP Apps is an extension in 2026-07-28 (SEP-2133 framework, identifier
# ``io.modelcontextprotocol/ui``). An empty ``Apps()`` only advertises it under
# ``capabilities.extensions`` (server/discover + initialize); our ui://
# resources and ``_meta.ui`` tool metadata are still registered by hand below
# so the same wire shapes reach handshake-era hosts that predate extensions.
