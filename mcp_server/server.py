"""FastMCP server that registers services as MCP tools and exposes app HTML resources.

Two registration paths (see `_tool_factory.py` for details):

- **Headless** (default): sync wrapper, returns the Pydantic output model directly.
- **Enhanced** (opt-in via `@enhance`): async wrapper with `Context`, may elicit
  user input, attach images/audio, or render an MCP App (iframe dashboard).

Primary transport is streamable HTTP, mounted on the FastAPI app at ``/mcp``
(see ``api_server/server.py``). Stdio is supported via the ``mymcp-mcp``
console script for local dev / Claude Desktop only.

See ``mcp_server/MCP_UI_ARCHITECTURE.md`` and ``mcp_server/MCP_UI_EDGE_CASES.md``.

# ``stateless_http=True`` makes every /mcp request self-contained: the server
# does not persist per-session state keyed by ``Mcp-Session-Id`` in memory.
# Stateful mode (the FastMCP default) breaks in exactly the deployments this
# template targets - Render free-tier spins down when idle, redeploys restart
# the process, and horizontal scaling routes requests across replicas - each of
# which wipes/splits the in-memory session store, so a client's next POST fails
# with "MCP session has been terminated or no longer exists on the server"
# (mcp_session_terminated). Some clients (OpenAI, and connectors that DELETE the
# session after each call) trigger the same error even single-replica. Stateless
# mode sidesteps all of it. Safe here because our enhancers only elicit input and
# render Apps - both happen *within* a single tool-call request's SSE stream - and
# we use no server-initiated sampling (the one feature that hangs stateless; see
# modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk issue 678).
#
# This is also where the spec is going: the MCP core is dropping session state at
# the protocol layer (SEP-2567 removes Mcp-Session-Id, SEP-2575 removes the
# initialize handshake; 2026-07-28 RC), so "any request can land on any instance."
# stateless_http=True is the SDK option the transport roadmap points implementers
# to today. It still runs the initialize handshake (the SDK keeps that until it
# implements those SEPs) but stops persisting/validating per-session state, which
# is what actually fixes the error - and it's forward-compatible with the RC.
