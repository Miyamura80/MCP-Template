"""Render the docs site's tool reference from the `@service` registry.

The tool surface has one source of truth - the registry - and the docs restated
it by hand. That drifted to 5 tools against a 34-tool registry with nothing
noticing, which is what issue #233 was about.

The first attempt at a fix parsed `docs/content/docs/mcp/tools.mdx` back into a
set of names and compared. That runs the pipeline backwards, and inferring
structured data from prose leaks: a pipe table inside a code fence, inside a
*deeply indented* code fence, or inside an MDX `{/* */}` comment all read as
live documentation, so a row could be deleted while a commented-out copy kept
the check green. Each was a separate patch to the same parser.

So: generate the region instead. Everything between the markers in
``TOOLS_PAGE`` is rendered from ``llm_tool_surface()`` plus the enhancer
registry, and ``--check`` fails when the file on disk disagrees. There is no
prose left to misread, and the "N tools" count is interpolated rather than
regex-matched, so it cannot go stale either.

Editorial input is the grouping in ``GROUPS`` below - which heading a tool sits
under, and the notes around each table. Descriptions come from the registry, so
the page shows exactly what an MCP client is told. A registered tool missing
from ``GROUPS`` is a hard error rather than a silent omission.
