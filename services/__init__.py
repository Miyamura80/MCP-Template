    the feature - the MCP layer converts this into a SEP-1036 URL elicitation

    - ``message`` must itself be a self-recovering script (what tool to call,
      what to do with the URL, then retry), because for hosts with no native
      affordance the exception text is the only channel that reaches them.

    Set ``mutating=True`` for services with side effects (create/charge/send)
    so the HTTP transport enforces ``Idempotency-Key`` and replays the stored
    response on retries. Leave it ``False`` (the default) for pure/read-only
    services. On MCP, the flag also gates the enhancer crash-fallback
    (``mcp_server/_tool_factory.py``): a mutating service is never silently
    re-executed - the fallback reuses the already-completed ``tool.call()``
    result or propagates the enhancer error. CLI behavior is unchanged.

    Set ``price`` (a decimal string like "0.001", in units of ``asset``) to
    sell the tool via the x402 paywall: HTTP and MCP calls must carry a valid
    ``X-PAYMENT`` header, which the server verifies and settles before running
    the service. Priced services bypass the free daily quota. Leaving ``price``
    as ``None`` keeps the service free and quota-limited. The paywall only
    activates when x402 is enabled in config, so a priced service still runs
    free (quota-limited) on a deployment that hasn't turned x402 on - the
    template keeps working with no wallet configured. CLI is never gated.
